/**
 * An instance of it represents a subscription to something (e.g. newspaper, 
 * but it doesnâ€™t really matter here). Each subscription has its total price, 
 * stored in the variable price. This price is in Euro-cent. It also has the 
 * length of the subscription, given in months.
 * 
 * For example, new Subscription(1000,2) will create a new subscription of 
 * 1000 Euro-cent for the total period of 2 months.
 * 
 * By the way, the class has a number of bugs; e.g. pricePerMonth is supposed 
 * to return the price per month in euro. However it calculates the price in cent.
